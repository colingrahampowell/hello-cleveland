file io notes:

variances in:
	1. room description: pre/post special action
	2. special action: stages / conditions

approach:
	1. use hash-map --> room_desc[ "pre" ] = x, etc. --> hard to generalize, however 
	2. use array (indices indicate stage) --> index into next 'stage'

file format idea:
	1. 	ROOM_DESC: x
		ROOM_DESC: y
		ROOM_DESC: z
		SPECIAL: a 
		SPECIAL: b
		SPECIAL: c
		START_ITEM: (item desc)
		etc.
	  	
		pseudocode:
		if( room_desc ):
			read desc, add to room_desc vector;
		else if (special)
			read desc, add to special vector;
		etc.

		we can consider indices as 'states'; advance from one state to the next by 
		taking actions.
			- probably want an 'advance state' function
